"The audit largely concurs with the
            Implementation Completion Reports' ratings of
            satisfactory outcomes, and likely sustainability of the
            Beira Transport Corridor, Maputo Corridor Revitalization
            Technical Assistance, and the Road and Coastal Shipping
            Projects, as well as on substantial institutional
            development impacts, except that for the Maputo Corridor
            Project, which is rated as high. Experience with these
            projects confirms the following lessons. First,
            privatization is a learning process, a complex undertaking,
            as well as a foreign concept in official circles in
            developing, and transition economies; thus, exposure to
            early success stories in the country, or outside is crucial.
            Second, the particular private sector participation option
            is determined by the government's political readiness.
            While some reforms are better suited than others at
            improving the transport sector, and eliciting maximum
            private investment, the reform option adopted depends on the
            government's will, and readiness for such particular
            reform option, as well as on its capacity to pursue it.
            Third, negotiations between the conceding authority, and
            preferred bidder can improve the terms of concession, when
            response from competitive tendering is inadequate.
            Interestingly, regardless of the inappropriateness of
            ex-post negotiations given the potential vulnerability to
            unfairness, in light of few bidders in the tendering
            process, such as the Maputo port concession, prudent
            negotiations may prove beneficial to achieve advantageous
            concession terms, and minimize the monopoly of potential concessionaires."
"The Hill Farming Technical
            Development Project in Pakistan was accomplished. Despite
            the slow startup, the project eventually achieved most of
            its goals. The Bank played an important role in meeting
            Pakistan's resource requirements for irrigation
            development. The International Development Association (IDA)
            performance was good. They provided necessary guidance
            through various review and technical missions during the
            period of implementation. The Bank carried out sixteen
            regular supervision missions and three technical missions,
            Continuity of supervision staff was reasonably well
            maintained, despite the prolonged implementation period.
            Problem areas were delayed in starting the project; contract
            packaging, contractor selection and management, which led to
            considerable delay in project implementation; and taking
            over and operation of drainage tubewells by the Punjab
            Irrigation Department (PID). The Water and Power Development
            Authority (WAPDA) was assisted by project consultants in the
            preparation of final project designs, tenders, award of
            contracts, and construction supervision. The Mission is
            congratulated for having prepared a good report."

"Consistent with the findings in the
            Project Completion Report (PCR), ratings for the Zimbabwe -
            Family Health Project were as follows: The project was rated
            as satisfactory, institutional development as substantial,
            and sustainability as likely. Some lessons learned include:
            During preparation for the audit, three issues were
            identified for attention: decentralization, costs and donor
            coordination. Although the project supports the
            decentralization of services, the question of what
            decentralization meant, and the precise relationships at the
            community level between various ministries, was not clearly
            identified in the project documents at appraisal, and
            relationships have evolved since that time. Difficulties
            attributable to the challenge of creating effective
            interagency relationships in the name of achieving project
            goals are evident in this project. For example, the
            strengthening of community level services was also
            negatively affected by the transfer of Village Health
            Workers (VHW) to the Ministry of Cooperatives, Community
            Development and Women's Affairs. The serious cost
            overruns in this project -- for civil works and for
            equipment -- indicate the importance of paying close
            attention to the bread and butter matters of design,
            tendering, procurement and maintenance. The main positive
            outcome of the cost overruns is the firm way in which the
            Ministry of Health (MOH) has realized that this must be
            avoided in future. One lesson drawn is the need for greater
            flexibility in the design of district hospitals. Finally,
            the development of a more proactive stance toward donor
            coordination on the part of the MOH, and reports of growing
            satisfaction with this approach among several donors,
            reinforces the lesson that greater ownership can increase
            the effectiveness of external resources for health activities."
